***************************************************************
* Security Policy Description:				      *
***************************************************************
1.) All devices from EvilGroup are denied access to any machine in the corporate network

	Configured on the inbound direction of the north interface


2.) Any outside machine can access Mail Relay server 136.201.5.30 via SMTP (on port TCP/25).

	Configured on both the inbound and outbound direction of the north interface


3.) Relay Mail server 136.201.5.30 can access any (outside) machine and Mail Server (136.201.10.20) via SMTP (port TCP/25).

	Configured ACLs on both the north and south interfaces for both the inbound and outbound directions


4.) Everybody can access the Web server 136.201.5.20 at port TCP/80 – make sure the client cannot use any server port (1-1023)

	Configured Reflective ACLs on interfaces (North, South and East) on both inbound and outbound direction


5.) Any outside machine can access the NNTP (Network News) server 136.201.5.10 on ports TCP/119 and TCP/433.

	Configured Reflective ACLs on the North interface for both inbound and outbound directions


6.) NNTP server 136.201.5.10 can only initiate connections to other machine on port TCP/433.

	Configured Reflective ACLs on the outbound north and south interfaces


7.) Web server can only initiate connections to the DataBase Server (136.201.10.30:1433). All other traffic from the web server must be return traffic to previous requests

	Configured Reflective ACL on the south interface outbound direction


8.) Only machines in the workstation subnet can access Mail Server via IMAP (on port TCP/143).

	Configured ACL on the inbound and outbound direction on the south interface

9.) Mail server (136.201.10.20) can access Relay Mail server via SMTP (port TCP/25)

	Configured ACL on the outbound and inbound direction on the server segment


10.) DataBase Server (136.201.10.30) can only be accessed by Web server (136.201.5.20), your own workstations (136.201.100.0/24) and your business partner (20.0.0.0/8) using SQL queries (TCP/1433). It can only react to incoming requests and is not allowed to initiate any connections

	Configured 2 deny ACLs on the outbound interface in the south interface. 
	This prevents Relay Mail server and NNTP access to Database server.
	A permit any ACL is configured on the outbound direction of the south interface. 
	This allows the rest of the devices to communicate to Database server


11.) Workstations (136.201.100.0/24) can access:
	o Any web server on ports TCP/80, TCP/8080 and TCP/443.
	o Your own DataBase server (136.201.10.30) for SQL queries (TCP/1433).
	o Only the business partner’s DNS server 20.1.1.1 for DNS queries (TCP/53 andUDP/53)
	o Mail server (136.201.10.20) for IMAP and SMTP.
	o NNTP (136.201.5.10) server on port TCP/119


	Configured Reflective ACL on both the inbound and outbound direction on the east interface.

***************************************************************
* ICMP Policy Description:				      *
***************************************************************
The ICMP policy is configured for the Workstation and server network to communicate to each other excluding all other entities. 
Reflexive ACL was used to to configure the policy so that only the requested ICMP packets will get a response.
This policy is somewhat restricted for a network engineer to go about trouble shooting the network. The policy should be expanded so that the Partner and the corporate network can communicate. The justification for the applied policy is that only users of the workstation should be able to diagnose problems encountered in the server network. 


***************************************************************
* Routing Protocol Description:				      *
***************************************************************
- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. 
- It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within a single autonomous system (AS).
- OSPF is on of the most widely used IGP in large enterprise networks.
- OSPF detects changes in the topology, such as link failures, and converges on a new loop-free routing structure within seconds.
- An OSPF network may be structured, or subdivided, into routing areas to simplify administration and optimize traffic and resource utilization.

OSPF was chosen in order to be able to subdivide routing areas in order to simplify adminstration and resource utilization.

"permit ospf any any" is the policy which is applied on both the outbound and inbound directions of the north interface which connects to the internet for OSPF to run across the layer 3 network.
